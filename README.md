# tictactoe_ia_v2
A tictactoe IA using MiniMax Algorithm.

## How to optimize speed
- [ ] If Max value (1) is touch by maximizing player : break ; Same for minimizing player
- [ ] Add a max depth
- [ ] If we found a loose, skip others tree
- [ ] Alpha-beta pruning
- [ ] Adapt the depth base on the state of the game
- [ ] The game is not terminate, evaluate the best choice. For example in Chess Game, your pieces remaining less opponents pieces remaining
